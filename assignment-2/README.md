

Well-commented Code: Ensure that your CSS code is well-organized and includes clear comments explaining the purpose of different styles, media queries, and animations. Here's a guideline for a green color theme:

/* Define primary green color */
:root {
    --primary-green: #4CAF50;  /* A vibrant green shade */
    --secondary-green: #A5D6A7;  /* Lighter green for accents */
}

/* Example: Apply the primary green to the background of the header */
header {
    background-color: var(--primary-green);
    /* This sets a green background for the header */
}

/* Media query for responsiveness */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    header {
        background-color: var(--secondary-green); 
        /* Lighter green for mobile screens */
    }
}

/* Animation: Fade-in effect for buttons with green background */
button {
    background-color: var(--primary-green);
    transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in;
}

button:hover {
    opacity: 0.7;
    /* Button fades slightly when hovered */
}

README File: Write a README file to document your design choices. Here's a template:

# Project Title: Green-Themed Website Design with CSS Animations and Media Queries

## Design Choices
- Primary Theme: The website uses a green color palette, symbolizing nature and sustainability.
- Color Scheme: The primary green (#4CAF50) is complemented by a lighter shade of green (#A5D6A7) for contrast.
- Animation: Buttons have a subtle fade-in effect when hovered, adding an interactive feel without overwhelming the user.

## How to View the Project
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. The website is responsive and adjusts based on screen size using media queries.

## Folder Structure
- css/: Contains the style files.
- js/: Contains any JavaScript (if applicable).


5. Creativity and Design (15 marks):

Originality in Visual Design and Animation Effects: For a green color theme, use a natural and calming design. Consider the following ideas:

Use different shades of green for different sections of the website to create a layered effect.

Include nature-related images (like leaves, trees, or green landscapes) as backgrounds or icons.

Animate buttons or hover effects, such as a smooth color transition or slight scaling.


Example CSS for a green-themed website with animations:

/* Apply the primary green as a background for the body */
body {
    background-color: var(--primary-green);
    color: white;
}

/* Apply green gradients for section headers */
h1, h2 {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #4CAF50, #A5D6A7);
    -webkit-background-clip: text;
    color: transparent;
}

/* Animated elements */
.icon {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: var(--primary-green);
    border-radius: 50%;
    transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.icon:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);  /* Slight scaling effect on hover */
}

Thematic Consistency: Keep a consistent green color scheme across all pages and sections. Use complementary colors sparingly to avoid clashing with the green theme. For fonts and icons, choose simple, clean designs that align with the theme of nature or growth.
